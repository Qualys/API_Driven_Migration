# QualysVirtualHostProcessor module


### QualysVirtualHostProcessor.convertVirtualHost(vhost: dict)
Converts a Virtual Hosts generated by getVirtualHosts() into a URL, excluding the FQDN, used in an API call
to recreate it

Parameters:

    vhost:              A python dictionary containing the keys ‘IP’, ‘PORT’, ‘FQDNS’ and optionally ‘NETWORK_ID’

        with their corresponding values

Returns:

    url:                The URL, excluding the FQDN, of the API call used to create the Virtual Host


### QualysVirtualHostProcessor.convertVirtualHosts(vhostlist: list)
Converts a list Virtual Hosts generated by getVirtualHosts() into URLs, excluding the FQDN, used in API calls
to recreate them

Parameters:

    vhost:              A python dictionary containing the keys ‘IP’, ‘PORT’, ‘FQDNS’ and optionally ‘NETWORK_ID’

        with their corresponding values

Returns:

    urllist:                The list of URLs, excluding the FQDN, of the API calls used to create the Virtual Hosts


### QualysVirtualHostProcessor.createVirtualHost(target_api: QualysAPI, url: str)
Creates a Virtual Hosts from a virtual host URL generated by convertVirtualHost()

Parameters:

    url:                A string value containing the URL, excluding the FQDN, to use in an API call to create

        a single Virtual Host

    target_api:         An object of the class QualysAPI

Returns:

    True                if the Virtual Hosts was successfully created
    False               if there was an error in the API response


### QualysVirtualHostProcessor.createVirtualHosts(urllist: list, target_api: QualysAPI)
Creates Virtual Hosts from a list of virtual host URLs generated by convertVirtualHosts()

Parameters:

    urllist:            A list of strings containing URLs, excluding the FQDN, to use in API calls to create

        Virtual Hosts

    target_api:         An object of the class QualysAPI

Returns:

    True                if all Virtual Hosts were successfully created
    False               on the first occurrence of an error in the API response


### QualysVirtualHostProcessor.getVirtualHosts(source_api: QualysAPI, networks: bool = False)
Get the virtual hosts from a subscription

Parameters:

    source_api:             An object of the class QualysAPI
    networks:               (Optional) A boolean value.  If True, includes Network ID for each Virtual Host

    > Defaults to False

Returns:

    hostlist:               A list of python dictionaries, each containing the keys ‘IP’, ‘PORT’, ‘FQDNS’ and

        optionally ‘NETWORK_ID’, and their corresponding values


### QualysVirtualHostProcessor.responseHandler(resp: Element)
