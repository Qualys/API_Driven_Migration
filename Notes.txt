Authentication Records
    We can create authentication records but only without passwords, there is no method by which
    passwords can be extracted from the platform.  To provide this means providing a list of passwords in plain text,
    which is not ideal but a useful stop-gap until decryption is added, allowing the input file to be AES-256 encrypted
Compliance Policies

IPv6 Mappings
