Authentication Records
    We can create authentication records but only without passwords, there is no method by which
    passwords can be extracted from the platform.  To provide this means providing a list of passwords in plain text,
    which is not ideal.
Compliance Policies
    QualysCompliancePolicyProcessor will export policies using the Export Policy API, however these policies do not include scope information, so any
    tag or asset group assignments will be lost during the export.
IPv6 Mappings
    Not implemented
