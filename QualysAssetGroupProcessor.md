# QualysAssetGroupProcessor module


### QualysAssetGroupProcessor.buildSimpleAssetGroup(name: str, ips: list)
Generates a URL to be used in an API call to create a simple Asset Group from a list of IP addresses

Parameters:

    name:           A string containing the name of the new Asset Group
    ips:            A list of strings containing IP addresses, ranges or CIDR addresses to be added to the new

    > Asset Group

Returns:

    url, payload:

        url         The URL to be used for the API call in a POST request
        payload     The payload to be used in the above API call


### QualysAssetGroupProcessor.build_asset_group_map(source_api: [QualysAPI](QualysAPI.md#QualysAPI.QualysAPI), target_api: [QualysAPI](QualysAPI.md#QualysAPI.QualysAPI), prefix: str | None = None)
Builds a map of source to target Asset Groups, optionally including a prefix to prepend to target Asset Group IDs

Parameters:

    source_api:         An object of type QualysAPI for the source subscription
    target_api:         An object of type QualysAPI for the target subscription
    prefix:             A string containing a prefix to use in naming target Asset Groups, defaults to None

    > signifying no prefix required

Returns:

    ag_map:             A Python Dictionary containing the source and target Asset Groups, where the source

        Asset Group ID is the key and the target Asset Group ID is the value


### QualysAssetGroupProcessor.convertAssetGroup(ag: Element, netmap: dict | None = None, appliancemap: dict | None = None)
Converts data produced by getAssetGroups() into a URL used to recreate the Asset Group

Parameters:

    ag:             A document of the type xml.etree.ElementTree.Element containing the Asset Group data as obtained

        by getAssetGroups()

    netmap:         A Python Dictionary providing a map of source to target Network IDs, where the source ID is the

        key and the target ID is the value.  Used to transform Network IDs from the old appliance to
        that required for the new appliance.  Defaults to None, signifying no Networks IDs are in use

    appliancemap:   A Python Dictionary providing a map of the source to target appliance IDs, where the source ID

        is the key and the target ID is the value.  Used to transform Network IDs from the old
        appliance to that required for the new appliance.  Defaults to None signifying that no
        appliances are added to the Asset Group

Returns:

    url, payload:

        url         The URL of the API call to make with the POST method to create the new scanner appliance
        payload     The HTTP payload to use in the API call

    or

    None if title of the Asset Group is ‘All’


### QualysAssetGroupProcessor.createAssetGroup(target_api: [QualysAPI](QualysAPI.md#QualysAPI.QualysAPI), url: str, payload: dict)
Creates an Asset Group from the provided URL and Payload

Parameters:

    target_api:         An object of type QualysAPI
    url:                A string containing the URL to be used to create the Asset Group, as generated by

    > convertAssetGroup() or buildSimpleAssetGroup()

    payload:            The payload to be used in the API call, as generated by convertAssetGroup() or

        buildSimpleAssetGroup()

Returns:

    resp:               A document of type xml.etree.ElementTree.Element containing the full API response


### QualysAssetGroupProcessor.getAssetGroups(source_api: [QualysAPI](QualysAPI.md#QualysAPI.QualysAPI))
Get a list of Asset Groups from a subscription

Parameters:

    source_api:         An object of type QualysAPI

Returns:

    aglist:           A document of type xml.etree.ElementTree.Element containing the ‘ASSET_GROUP_LIST’ element

        from the API response


### QualysAssetGroupProcessor.responseHandler(response: Element)
