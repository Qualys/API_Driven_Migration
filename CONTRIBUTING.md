# Welcome to the API Driven Migraiton contributor's guide

Thank you for taking the time to help contribute to this repository.  There are a few ways you can help develop this codebase, the sections below will provide the details on how you can contribute.

* Reporting bugs
* Fixing reported bugs
* Contributing new functions to existing function libraries
* Contributing new function libraries
* Developing new tests or maintaining existing tests

## Bugs

### Reporting Bugs
Bugs can be raised through the Issues feature in Github.  Existing contributors will be notified of any new bugs, however as this codebase is not officially supported we would appreciate any help.  Which brings us to...

### Fixing reported bugs
If you see a reported bug in the codebase, or if you find a bug and want to provide both the bug report and the fix (firstly you are a legend, thank you) then please create a Pull Request.  This will be reviewed and accepted if appropriate.

## Contributing

### New Functions
If you would like to develop a new function to an existing library, please create a Pull Request.  This will be reviewed and accepted if appropriate.

### New function libraries
If you would like to create a whole new library complete with functions (again, legend, thank you) please create a Pull Request.  I hope you are starting to spot a theme here - Pull Requests are the best way to contribute.

## Testing

Testing is always difficult as subscription content can vary wildly.  If you would like to help by writing test scripts for functions which don't already have them (and there are quite a few, this is the one area of the codebase which receives the least attention) then please create a Pull Request.
